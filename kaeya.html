			<p id='appearance'>Kaeya is a tall young man with a slim build and a dark complexion. His visible eye is sharp and slanted, periwinkle with long eyelashes and the same diamond-shaped pupil as Dainsleif. He has navy-blue hair with streaks of lighter blue, accompanied by a long lock of hair that rests over his left shoulder, cascading down to his waist. His bangs are trimmed in a lengthy fringe that covers the right side of his face and almost hides a plain black eyepatch, which he claims to have inherited from his grandfather, a pirate. However, this was later revealed to be a lie he told to mess with people.  <br>
				<br> Kaeya's clothes are fitting for a Cavalry Captain, albeit a flamboyant one. He wears a white, collared, cleavage-revealing blouse with forearm-length sleeves that have dark blue folded cuffs. Above that, he wears what appears to be a light blue vest or jacket, and a cape adorned with a fur collar. He wears dark, tight-fitted trousers and knee-length boots. For accessories, he wears fingerless gloves with spikes on the wrists and marked with the same diamond shape as his eyes. He also wears a loose brown belt from which his Vision hangs, as well as a rope which may be meant for a scabbard to carry his sword. He has a single earring on his left ear, which has some kind of blue gem on a metal frame shaped like a teardrop with a spike at the bottom. The same gems are found hanging off of two straps at his ankles. His outfit has many more small details, such as a blue band around his forearms to keep his cuffs folded, a chain across his chest that seems to be attached to the ends of his collars, and unexplained straps, belts or bands. His outfit, Icy Featherflight, is described to be fashionable and adorned with a fur collar.
